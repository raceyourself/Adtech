Based off CatBlock 2.6.14.

Replaces adverts with arbitrary image content.

Requires the custom AdBlock fork in this repository.

Note that there are several references in the code to Chrome plugin IDs. These are generated when developer-mode plugins are added to Chrome, so will need to be updated with the IDs in chrome://extensions - to find such IDs, look for this in this project and the custom AdBlock in this repository.
